Hello! My name is Riya Sharma, and I am currently a student at The George Washington University pursuing a double major in Political Science and Data Science with a minor in Journalism and Mass Communication. I am interested in the intersection between data science and politics, especially in regards to policy analysis and both domestic and international policymaking regarding Indigenous peoples, women and girls, and their rights.

In my free time, I enjoy biking, learning languages, and exploring D.C!
