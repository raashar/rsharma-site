    "text": "Introduction\nFor this assignment you’ll be making a few charts and maps using the ggplot2 and tmap packages we discussed in the last class session.\nTo help in your efforts, do feel free to make use of and adapt the materials we went over in class, which are located here.\nThe data used for this assignment includes Georgia election results by county for U.S. Senate and Governor in 2022, President in 2020, and then some of the same socioeconomic factors we’ve looked at other contexts so far during the semester.\n\nLoading the Data\nThe first step is to load in the data, which is stored in the ga_votes.xlsx Excel file that’s included in this repository. As you’ll see if you open the spreadsheet itself, there are two tabs - one contains the senate results, and one contains the governor results.\nWe’ll load them separately into two datasets to be used for the remainder of this assignment.\n\n#import the GA election data for this assignment\n\n#GA senate\nsenate_results <- read_excel(here(\"ga_votes.xlsx\"), sheet = \"senate\")\n\n#GA governor\ngovernor_results <- read_excel(here(\"ga_votes.xlsx\"), sheet = \"governor\")\n\nTwo columns in particular to highlight that we’ll use to examine how the Republican Senate and Governor candidates did compared with former President Trump’s performance in 2020:\n\npct_r_above_trump. This column calculates the difference in percentage points between what the 2022 Republican candidate got (pct_r_2022) and what Trump got two years earlier (pct_r_2020). A negative value means the candidate did worse than Trump, a positive value means they did better.\nis_r_above_trump. This companion columns is a so-called “flag” column, which provides a Yes/No as to whether the Republican candidate did better or worse than Trump.

    "text": "In my News Writing and Reporting class, I wrote a story about the experience of international students studying during virtual school in the 2020-2021 academic year at GW.\n_________________________________________________\nRemote learning proves challenging for international students at The George Washington University\nIn Dubai, GW freshman Nour Ellahham goes to sleep at 5 a.m. and wakes up at 10 a.m. Gulf Standard Time to attend classes. One and a half hours ahead of her in Hyderabad, Ajay Uppaluri “passes out” after completing schoolwork from 4:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. Indian Standard Time.  \nMore than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, students and faculty at GWU are still confronting the challenges of virtual learning. For international students, the pressure of managing work is compounded by studying in sometimes opposite time zones. While they struggle to socialize and submit assignments, international students try to adapt alongside professors who work to accommodate their schedules.\nEllahham, a freshman majoring in political science at GWU, began her first year of college in Dubai instead of Washington, D.C, where the university is located.\n“If I could describe my online learning experience in one word, I would definitely say frustrating,” Ellahham said.\nOne of about 4,000 international students at the university, Ellahham restructured her entire schedule to attend five classes a week, all of which are synchronous, or live.\n“I don’t really have a routine anymore. It’s confusing when my brain is in Eastern Standard Time, but my body is in Gulf Standard Time. I never know when I should be working or sleeping,” Ellahham said.\nInternational students’ challenges go beyond academics. In addition to managing 16 credits this semester, Ellahham has experienced difficulty engaging in student life. Because meetings conflict with her schedule, she has not been able to join GW UNICEF, GW College Democrats, or other organizations she finds interesting.  \n“It was really, really hard for me to not join a student org. I wanted to get involved, but I am also trying to get through school on top of balancing a lot of external life responsibilities,” Ellahham said.\nUppaluri, a sophomore majoring in political science at GWU, traded campus life for family life after moving back to India from the United States. Although he now lives with his parents, Uppaluri follows Eastern Standard Time to attend synchronous classes, making it hard for him to interact with family daily.\n“I’m spending more time with them than before, but it’s not as much as I want to,” Uppaluri said.\nAfter studying throughout the week, Uppaluri can only visit his grandparents on Saturday and spend time relaxing with his cousins on Sunday. However, because he spends his entire weekend with family, Uppaluri cannot catch up on the sleep he needs to continue pulling all-nighters.\n“I don’t have balance. I push myself…It’s this weird middle ground, which is not fun. I don’t enjoy it,” Uppaluri said.\nFewer international students are attending U.S. schools because of the pandemic and the challenge of online learning. The enrollment of new international students into U.S. institutions fell 43% from 2019, according to a survey conducted by the Institute of International Education.\nTo maintain participation among enrolled international students, professors at GWU have made adjustments to accommodate their unique schedules. While some conduct synchronous lectures, others give international students the option to learn asynchronously, or on their own time.  \nDr. Efrat Nechushtai, an assistant professor in GWU’s School of Media and Public Affairs, records live lectures for international students in different time zones to watch asynchronously. To facilitate engagement with course material, Nechushtai requires these students to communicate what they’ve learned and don’t understand in one page.\n“I wanted to make sure that the course is flexible and that they [international students] have this choice to take and engage with the course in any way that is most suitable for their current situation,” Nechushtai said.\nIn addition to individual course adjustments, professors have access to FLEX Camp workshops held by GWU Libraries and Academic Innovation. These two-day boot camps offer professors a comprehensive guide on designing courses for remote teaching. With over 10 workshops in summer and more throughout the year, educators can discover new ways to accommodate international students learning online.\n“Any professor at GWU has access to many different kinds of programs to help think about how to make the transition [to remote teaching] in the best, most effective way possible,” Nechushtai said.\nInternational students praised the accommodations professors have provided.\n“I have all of these things to be grateful for. I have great professors who have been trying so hard to make remote learning manageable for me,” Ellahham said.\nUppaluri offered advice to other international GWU students learning virtually. “Try to manage your time as much as you can and speak to your professors. They are super understanding and want to help you,” Uppaluri said.\n\n\n\n\nAs an intern for the Borgen Project, an organization dedicated to ending global poverty, I wrote articles for both Borgen Magazine and the Borgen Project’s blog on global issues and efforts being made to eradicate poverty in various countries.\n\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on Poverty in Mongolia\nHow Children of Vietnam Helps Fight Poverty\nHouse Resolution Hopes to Fight COVID-19 and Poverty in Africa\nThe RENACER Act is Supporting Human Rights in Nicaragua\nHow Organizations are Fighting the Education Crisis in Yemen\nHow Sen. Cory Booker is Supporting Women in Developing Countries\n4 Organizations Helping Women in Asia\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on Poverty in Afghanistan"

    "text": "This is a paper I wrote which discusses objectivity in journalism through the lenses of advocacy journalism, campaign journalism, and the purported ideal of scientific objectivity in reporting.\n_________________________________________\nFrom its start, journalism has significantly developed, becoming more nuanced and expansive as reporters and the public interact together in the production and dissemination of news. For decades, one of journalism’s mainstays throughout the coverage of increasingly complex events has been objectivity. For both the newsroom and consumers of news, objectivity has cemented itself as a tenet of journalism and as the foundation of accurate, precise reporting. In recent years and especially in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, this canon within the media has transformed and branched out into various forms, including advocacy journalism, campaign journalism, and the search for scientific-like objectivity. To understand these three, examining discussions by various scholars and the hard, reported news that reflects these different perspectives is necessary. By doing so, readers may be able to further understand existing divisions of objectivity and how they operate in different journalistic spheres.  \n\n\nPart of what makes diverse facets of objectivity so fascinating is how they are not always beholden to the traditional ideal of objectivity. Case in point: advocacy journalism. This standard deviates from the traditional norm of impartiality because, in its essence, advocacy journalism is driven by a call for a particular goal and outcome. To accomplish the fulfillment of a specific goal, advocacy requires journalists to “take serious thought and purposeful action” for a cause, as Ida B. Wells emphasized in an effort to mobilize Black journalists to report on lynchings and, as a result, inform citizens and ameliorate racial disparities (Wells “The Requirements of Southern Journalism”). In continuation with Wells’s call to action, Black journalists created their own newspapers to adequately educate others on racial issues, specifically those pertaining to Black and African Americans within the United States. In the wake of protests related to racially-motivated attacks and murders of these individuals, such newspapers have used their platform to promote equality, equity, and justice for Black and African American citizens. \nFor example, The Los Angeles Sentinel, a weekly-African American newspaper, published two separate articles on events occurring in the summer of 2020. In one piece, the Sentinel News Service used the Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti’s, remarks as a vehicle to encourage participation in ongoing protests, stating, “The Mayor’s announcement shows us all why we must keep pushing and why Angelenos must keep speaking out and showing up for Black lives. We must keep going until we tear down this wall [of disinvestment] completely.” (Sentinel News Service “Statement on Mayor Garcetti’s Announcements During Ongoing Protests”). In another, Executive Publisher Danny Bakewell, Sr. echoed similar sentiments while simultaneously cautioning readers on the dangers of protesting during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying, “..we cannot now risk destroying our city or our health by engaging in activities which put our community or our lives in jeopardy...Let’s be smart, let’s be safe and let’s keep the faith and please VOTE, VOTE, VOTE!!” (Bakewell Statement from the Executive Publisher on Death and Protest of George Floyd). \nAs illustrated in these excerpts of reported news, these advocacy journalists have redefined objectivity by urging readers to engage in protests and vote while simultaneously reporting on the statistics and other facts that accompany stories. In addition to fulfilling the role of advocates, these journalists help bring together members of the Black/African American community, as ethnic newspapers did in times of crisis. As scholar Leara D. Rhodes described, “Racism prompted the development of ethnic media.” (Rhodes 47-48). Just as lynchings prompted Ida B. Wells to pursue advocacy journalism, protests, both past and present, have led to the formation of newspapers, like The Los Angeles Sentinel, that amplify Black/African American voices while encouraging change through connection with consumers. \nDespite serving these functions, advocacy journalism has its limitations. For instance, although they appeal to American citizens, newspapers that prioritize advocacy tend to be of a smaller scale. As a result, they may suffer in their ability to consistently reach and influence policymakers who hold power to enact official reform. Progress through individual citizens holds the risk of being lengthy and more miniscule than high-profile reporters on FOX News or CNN. \n\n\n\nIn a similar vein as advocacy journalism, the standard of campaign journalism operates within the framework of impartiality. While it shares the goal of advocating attention to a particular problem, campaign journalism does not require journalists to call action towards said problem. As sociologist Rodney Benson described, campaign journalism requires reporters “to focus their energies..on alerting the public to the most important events and issues of the day” instead of “allowing an autocratic-styled president to set the news agenda” (Benson 213). This standard of objectivity and coverage focuses on continued analysis of an issue both the public and the press deem appropriate, like racial justice and related protests. In addition to ongoing broadcasting of these events in the summer of 2020, journalists concentrated on the actions of politicians and political parties in response to racial injustice so they sustain ” reporting—-and repeating—-the truth” (Benson 214). \nTake, for example, New York Times journalist Astead W. Herndon, who analyzed a discrepancy between elected Democrats’ actions and public demands for reforming systemic racism in the weeks after the murder of George Floyd. He writes, “activists are saying they’re worried that politicians are using the language of systemic reform but stopping short of the more radical policies to address it, such as redirecting funding from law enforcement to housing and education” (Herndon “For George Floyd’s Mourners, What Does ‘Justice’ Mean?”). Instead of simply moving from one beat to the next, Herndon’s article engages in sustained coverage of racial justice and reform as it enters the rhetoric of policy-making politicians, specifically those in the Democratic party. \nSimilarly, additional New York Times journalists coupled news of activism with the actions of politicians, like current Vice President Kamala Harris. In August 2020, they wrote, “Since becoming California’s attorney general in 2011, she had largely avoided intervening in cases involving killings by the police. Protesters in Oakland distributed fliers saying:”Tell California Attorney General Kamala Harris to prosecute killer cops! It’s her job!“’ (Hakim et al.”‘Top Cop’ Kamala Harris’s Record of Policing the Police”). Characteristic of the tenets of campaign journalism outlined by scholars, such as Benson, these journalists continuously reported on a movement—-even in the months after Black Lives Matter and accompanying protests initially swept the nation—-because it affects numerous American citizens. Furthermore, by relaying the facts behind Harris’s inaction, they provided valuable material to the public so they remained well-informed and educated on a candidate. \nWhile Herndon and additional journalists prioritized objectivity and impartiality in their reporting of the Democratic party and its politicians, they continued to serve the public by acting as watchdogs. In doing so, these journalists allowed readers to fully understand and develop their thoughts on the bigger issues at hand in the 2020 presidential election and the country as a whole. Despite these benefits, however, campaign journalism becomes limited when this sustained coverage takes away from the dissemination of other, important news. While the public may become well-versed in the activist agendas of certain political figures, their knowledge of additional domains may diminish, resulting in an ill-informed community. \n\n\n\nWhile the branches of advocacy and campaign journalism emphasize how journalists may adapt their style of reporting to the dynamic nature of what is being covered, a separate approach—-scientific-like objectivity—-prioritizes the circulation of undiluted facts to quell misinterpretation. Famed writer Walter Lippmann highlighted this standard and its goal, saying, “I try to indicate that the perplexities of government and industry are conspiring to give political science this enormous opportunity to enrich itself and serve the public” (Lippmann 32).\nIn contrast with American philosopher John Dewey, who viewed “the role of experts as ancillary to that of citizens,” (Dewey and Rogers 30) Lippmann argues that the publication of facts and figures from research centers—-rather than citizens—-eases confusion created by “pseudo environments,” or the perceptions beholden by individuals due to their unique experiences. \nThis proliferation of data can be seen even in the light of social, not technological events, like the police brutality that prompted protests across the United States. For instance, The Washington Post instructed journalists to create and contribute to databases that gather statistical information regarding racial groups affected by police brutality. Accompanying these figures are analysis paragraphs by journalists, so the research is not inaccessible to ordinary citizens, curbing one of Dewey’s fears. One such paragraph explains the inordinate percentage of attacks against Black Americans, stating, “Although half of the people shot and killed by police are White, Black Americans are shot at a disproportionate rate. They account for less than 13 percent of the U.S. population, but are killed by police at more than twice the rate of White Americans” (Tate et al. “Fatal Force: Police shootings Database”). Not only do these databases reach the goal of empiricism and visible evidence through graphs that reflect data from research centers, but they also implement links to further reliable sources. The combination of these actions results in the propagation of a factual, impartial standard of objectivity. \nInstead of falling prey to partisanship or misinformation, the professionalization of journalists and the introduction of more scientific data journalism may ward off the infiltration of propaganda within the news. In conjunction with this, data journalism’s reliance on certainty reduces the risk that “the news consumer may accuse both the reporter and the news organization of bias,” a concern outlined by scholar Gaye Tuchman (Tuchman 665). However, data journalism still brings some limitations, one being alienation from issues. While statistics and other pieces of factual information are useful for visualizing material, they prevent readers from accessing discussions, quotes, and other facets of traditional reporting that allow citizens to understand issues and form opinions on them. \n\n\n\nThe approaches of advocacy journalism, campaign journalism, and scientific-like objectivity all offer unique perspectives and advantages to the field of reporting, as exemplified in theoretical and philosophical pieces by scholars and excerpts from published articles. While some argue that one method of writing takes precedence over others, it is clear that all three are equally valuable and necessary in today’s society. Advocacy and campaign journalism demonstrate pressing issues directly to readers, with advocacy prompting important social change and campaign promoting literacy on public or political affairs. Offering empirical knowledge, scientific-like objectivity presents direct, factual evidence to citizens so they do not fall prey to misinformation and bias within the media. These approaches play off of each other within articles, like those published during and after racial justice protests, in order to enrich the sphere of journalism and those who consume it. \n\n\n\nBakewell, Danny. “Statement from the Executive Publisher on Death and Protest of George Floyd.” Los Angeles Sentinel, Los Angeles Sentinel, 11 June 2020, lasentinel.net/179124.html. \nBenson, Rodney. “The Case for Campaign Journalism.” Trump and the Media, by Pablo J.

Let’s quickly review how we use it.\n\n\nYour original .Renviron will be backed up and stored in your R HOME directory if needed.\n\n\nYour API key has been stored in your .Renviron and can be accessed by Sys.getenv(\"CENSUS_API_KEY\"). \nTo use now, restart R or run `readRenviron(\"~/.Renviron\")`\n\n\n[1] \"2a6f8c21a30d3024e038d67d7d4eba647dc79cd4\"\n\n\n\n#chose variables we want\nmyvars <- c(totalpop = \"B01003_001\",\n            medincome = \"B19013_001\",\n            medage = \"B01002_001\"\n)\n\n\n#pull for GA counties\nga_counties_withgeo <- get_acs(geography = \"county\",\n                       variables = c(myvars),\n                       state = \"GA\",\n                       output = \"wide\",\n                       geometry = TRUE)\n\nGetting data from the 2017-2021 5-year ACS\n\n\nDownloading feature geometry from the Census website.  To cache shapefiles for use in future sessions, set `options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)`.\n\n\n\n  |                                                                            \n  |
